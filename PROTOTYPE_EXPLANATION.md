# Ocean Hazard Reporter - Prototype Explanation & Azure Cloud Architecture

## 🌊 Project Overview

### What is Ocean Hazard Reporter?
The Ocean Hazard Reporter is a comprehensive **real-time marine safety platform** designed to protect coastal communities through crowdsourced hazard reporting and professional verification systems. This prototype demonstrates a scalable solution for marine disaster management, particularly relevant for India's 7,500+ km coastline.

### 🎯 Problem Statement
- **Lack of real-time ocean hazard information** for coastal communities
- **Delayed response times** to marine emergencies
- **Poor coordination** between citizens, authorities, and rescue services
- **Limited accessibility** to official marine safety data

### 💡 Our Solution
A **community-driven platform** that combines:
- **Citizen reporting** with location-based hazard documentation
- **Professional verification** by marine safety experts
- **Real-time alerts** and emergency notifications
- **Interactive mapping** with Azure Maps integration
- **Analytics dashboard** for trend analysis and response optimization
